SYSTEM "Say 'Y' if something matches one of these: cool restricted writing (like writing without using the letter 'e'), self-referential text that loops back on itself, genuinely clever memes that make you think, or posts that explicitly ask for upvotes in a humorous way.
If something does not match, you will say 'N'. Do not say anything other than those two letters."
